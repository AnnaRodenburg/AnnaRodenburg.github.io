I created this portfolio by using adobe XD and putting all my best stregths in one, my videography, photography, and coding. I wanted to make this prototype
to introduce myself to others who may be interested in my work as it is all in the same place and simple to navigate and find what they want to
look at. If they were interested in my video, coding or photography skills they navigate to that section and see what I had to offer, which could help in the future. The challenges that I faced while creating this website was I was unsure and struggling with how to integrate the layout from my orginal mockup to the web design. 
I then figured that I could use flexbox and this can help me recreate what my orginal mockup consisted of.  All in all, I learned how to use flexbox
effectively and to my advantage to help build this site. It also helped me become familar with how to integrate something I see on a screen and try to replicate that with coding. This project helped me overall become more comfortable writing code.
